A Headset Stand with RGB

I wanted to purchase a headset stand with rgb. But all I found on Amazon was very limited in reatures and was very overpriced. Therefore I decides to make my own.
The RGB is controlled by Arduino with FASTLED library and a few addressable LED strips WS2812B.

As well you can control different patterns using the app written using Processing. Using COM PORT communication, the app allowes you to chose a different pattern,
change the speed of the patterns, change the brightness and loop all of the patterns.

Choose the appropriate comport like so:

And then open port
